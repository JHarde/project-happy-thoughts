# Happy Thoughts

This is an app in which the user can post a happy thought and see what other people are posting as well. The user can also like other peoples posts using a heart button. I have used an API in this project, it's built with react using state and hooks. 

## The problem

My biggest problem was making the like button work correctly. Initially it posted the information but didn't fetch it back until I refreshed the page. After a while I manage to see the updated change, however I got a bad request 400 and it liked all the posts. After inspecting the code for a while I found the problem and was able to solve it.
